This is a NodeJS library designed as a connector to the Official HoYoLab API, commonly accessed by browsers easily and quickly. This library supports both ESM and CJS, but can only be used in NodeJS environments starting from version 8.17 and above.

This repository is forked from [HoyoApi](https://github.com/vermaysha/hoyoapi/), which is no longer maintained. Therefore, I have refactored the code, added new features, and will continue to maintain and update this repository.

## About Redeem Function

why the function isnot working?
because the the API/site [Genshin Impact Gift](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/gift) cookie token has a short expiration time, so if it has expired, it needs to be manually refreshed. It has been observed that every few days, when logging in to the game Hoyoverse, it always requests reauthentication first.
